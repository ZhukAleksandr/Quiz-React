[-] First homework will be dedicated to initializing our project and adding our first screen with a couple of reusable UI components. Our application is a Quiz app, in which users configure their quiz settings, then we get the required amount of questions from API and start the quiz. We also show results at the end and save user statistics locally to show them later on a separate screen. First screen, which is a quiz configuration screen should include following components:

[-] Number input for “number of questions”. Value have to be from 5 to 15 Select input for “category” 
[-] Select input for “difficulty” 
[-] Select input for “type” 
[-] Select input for “time” with values: 1m, 2m, 5m 
[-] “Start quiz” button 
[-] “See my stats” button
